# BERT Sentiment Analysis with Streamlit

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled texts and is capable of predicting whether a given text has a positive or negative sentiment. The model is deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction.
